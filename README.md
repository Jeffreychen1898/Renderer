# My Renderer

This is a simple renderer written in C++ and OpenGL 4.1 (because Mac only supports up to version 4.1). This renderer is only tested on a Macbook Air but it can probably run on (but not tested) other platforms. The Makefile may need to be adjusted if used on a different platform.

## How to use it
Building the Library
```cd deps```
```make all```
```cd ../src/Renderer```
```make all```

Running the tests
```cd test/<folder name>```
```make all```
Navigate to the root of the repository
The executable should be in the "testbin" folder
